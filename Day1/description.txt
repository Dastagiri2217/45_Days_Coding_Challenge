📌 Problem Statement
Given an integer array, determine if it contains any duplicates. Return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, otherwise return false.
Solution :
This Java application solves the "Contains Duplicate" problem using different algorithmic strategies and applies the Factory Design Pattern to switch between them in a clean, extensible, and structured way.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

💻 Java

🧪 Scanner for input

🔄 HashSet for efficient duplicate checking

🧱 Factory Design Pattern to decouple logic and enhance maintainability

🧠 Algorithms Implemented
Brute Force Approach

Compares every pair of elements.

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)

HashSet Approach

Uses a HashSet to track seen elements (since sets don’t allow duplicates).

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

🧩 Design Pattern Used: Factory Pattern
The Factory Pattern allows selecting the duplicate-checking strategy dynamically based on user input. It improves:

Code readability

Adherence to SOLID principles
